What did I learn/get out of this: 

Learned about media queries (though I'd still like to explore about this more).
Learned about shape-outside. 
Learned about BEM (Block-Element-Modifier). I should practice this more.
Re-inforcing my git skills 

TODO:

Can I incorporate JS into this? 
Maybe an add to cart?
